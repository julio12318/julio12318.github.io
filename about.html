<h1>About Me</h1>

<!-- Introduction and Background -->
<section>
    <h2>Introduction and Background</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Julio Morales-Mena, and I was born and raised in Worcester, MA. Growing up in a community that valued perseverance and 
        resilience, I developed a strong passion for STEM subjects at an early age. Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics always 
        intrigued me because they offered endless opportunities to explore, create, and solve real-world problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        My formal journey into the world of Computer Science began during my time at South High Community School. It was here, surrounded by 
        inspiring teachers and peers, that I discovered how powerful technology could be in shaping the future. I was fortunate to be part of the 
        Goddard Scholars Academy, a rigorous academic program that nurtured my intellectual curiosity and prepared me for greater challenges ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
        Graduating in the top 10 of my class was a defining moment, as it earned me a full-ride scholarship to Clark University. My college career 
        started with a strong focus on Computer Science, where I delved into a variety of topics ranging from programming and algorithms to 
        database management and server-client communications. I particularly enjoyed hands-on projects, such as developing a mobile app that helps 
        users stay active and creating a website to track stocks, both of which showcased my ability to merge creativity with technical expertise.
    </p>
    <p>
        As my college journey progressed, I discovered the interdisciplinary power of Data Science and decided to pursue it as a minor. This addition 
        allowed me to expand my skill set and explore new opportunities in analyzing and visualizing data to uncover patterns and insights. Whether 
        it's understanding market trends in economics, optimizing healthcare systems, or solving problems in business, I am passionate about using 
        data-driven solutions to make a meaningful impact.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today, I am excited to combine my knowledge of Computer Science and Data Science to tackle challenges that matter. My journey is one of 
        constant learning, growth, and a commitment to making technology accessible and impactful for all.

    <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
    <p>
        Outside of Computer Science and Data Science, I have a strong love for Mathematics. My expertise spans 
        Analytic Geometry, Multivariable Calculus, and Proofs, and at one point, I even considered it as my major. 
        Iâ€™ve also explored Game Design, taking courses in 2D Game Design and 3D Modeling. Other areas of interest 
        include Physics and Economics, where I enjoy uncovering the theoretical and practical applications of these disciplines.
