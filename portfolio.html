    <h2>Project Name: Stock Tracker App</h2>
    <p><strong>Workers:</strong> Julio Morales-Mena, Jaden Lewis</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong>
        This project was completed between September to December 2024 as a part of my Software Engineering class, where student were tasked to create a web
        application of their choosing, but neeeded to use resources such as Jira to record sprints that would keep track of a group's 2-week plan. Our group
        created an Application that focused on recording the stocks that a User may be interested in purchasing or selling without having to actually buy or sell stocks.
        Users can look up stock information by a company's ticker, and they can wishlist it to view it later, buy it to add to their portfolio, or sell it from their portfolio.
        The application provides an easy method for users, especially beginners, to understand how stock buying and sell work, and how to improve their portfolios. All stock data
        is provided by Yahoo Finance.

    <h2>Project Name: Workout Buddy</h2>
    <p><strong>Workers:</strong> Julio Morales-Mena, Patrick Ziegler, Liam Wang, Alex Hirth</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong>
        This project was completed between October to December 2024 as a part of my Mobile Software Development class, where groups developed mobile applications that
        were designed to satisfy the needs of a certain local audience, such as a local restaurant or students at a certain college. The Workout Buddy application was desgined
        for users who were looking for simple workouts to perform by creating a weekly planner that users can add them in. These workouts deplayed instructions, pictures, 
        the necessary equipment, and more. Workouts could be sorted by body part, and when a workout was completed, it would be logged and can be seen in a user's history.
        The application was developed in Android Studio, and implemented API services and Room databases to perform the necessary tasks.
